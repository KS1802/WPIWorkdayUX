                      Workday Critique
                      </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p class="subtitle-a">
                      MyWorkday is a scheduling and financial tool used by WPI students, professors, and administrators. Through the application, students are able to register for classes, view academic progression, pay tuition, and perform other relevant academic and financial tasks. In this sense, Workday serves as an automated mediary between students and administration. WPI began implementing Workday last year, with the purpose to replace the old scheduling and financial software: Banner Web. Thus far, the introduction of Workday has created some frustration for students who have not adjusted to the new user interface. This paper will analyze the current website for ways that Workday could improve their website design and overall user experience. Looking at the website from a perspective of best practices, we see many shortcomings in the website.

                    <h3 class="title text-left">
                      Simplicity
                    </h3>
                    <p class="subtitle-a">
                      The scheduling process in particular is rather unnecessarily complicated in the Workday Academics homepage. In the course search process, the current procedures are rather detailed and may be too overwhelming to the user. The course search popup menu, for example, requires the user to choose from four start date periods, future, current, past, and non-year. For students registering for next semester courses, the plethora of options may not be entirely beneficial, and can even be rather annoying to click through subsections just to get to next semester courses. In total, it takes four clicks just to navigate to the current term. A use case that Workday should consider is the student that already knows which course they want to take. A search bar option would prove useful in that it saves users from having to fill out search conditions.  Once the user navigates to the course search menu, there are 13 filter sections for the student to choose from. Some of these sections are repetitive and rather unnecessary and thus add to the complexity of the course search page.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="title text-left">
                      Visual Hierarchy
                    </h3>
                    <p class="subtitle-a">
                      The visual hierarchy in some instances of the site is misleading, with some less important dashboards being larger than more important sections. In the academics dashboard, we see the “helpful links” banner taking up a large amount of screen space at the top of the screen. Workday should consider moving or shrinking the banner as the placement takes the users’ attention away from the main registration content. Furthermore, the “Actions to Do” section takes up about a quarter of the screen. It is a rather simple dashboard that displays the number of: tasks that a user must complete, holds on their account, and tasks that a user has completed. Because it does not display any significantly important information, it may be beneficial to reduce the size of the dashboard and utilize the space more effectively. 
	                    On a positive note, the “Financials” homepage within the application is well put together. The information boxes on the top banner of the homepage provide important and relevant payment and insurance notifications. The payment dashboard makes it obvious to the student about their outstanding balances and how much they may owe. The make payment and view statement buttons are placed strategically under the balance owed, which makes it easy for the user to take action when they see their owed balance.One critique that could be made is that the outstanding account balance is displayed in three different sections. However, all of these sections have different purposes: one displaying account balance minus aid, one displaying account activity, and one displaying all outstanding charges. It may be beneficial for Workday to combine aspects of all of these sections into one cohesive section to make the dashboard a little less repetitive. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="title text-left">
                      Navigability
                    </h3>
                    <p class="subtitle-a">
                      The overall site is relatively navigable. The back buttons are consistently in the top left corner, which makes it easy to navigate to the previous page that you came from. One feature that Workday could add is a frequently visited pages shortcut on the homepage. Additionally, one other critique that we have is that there is no explicit link to click to get to the search course page. Users must first click into the find courses search tool before being able to get to the search courses page. As highlighted above, this can be a tedious process.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="title text-left">
                      Accessibility
                    </h3>
                    <p class="subtitle-a">
                      The biggest accessibility issue with the Workday site is the fact that function buttons are not immediately obvious. In some cases, users must click one link or button to get to another button. This is seen when trying to remove a course from the favorites list, users must click on a non-labeled, generic “three dot button” to see the option to remove the course from the list. The act of clicking one button just to get to another button seems unnecessary and redundant.
                      User processes could be much more obvious to navigate to. There is no clear area or button to click to begin the registration process. In BannerWeb, there was a “create a schedule button”, which would lead students through a course selection then registration process. Because the registration menu in Workday lacks this main process button, students end up clicking multiple buttons until they figure out where to navigate to.
                      One final annoyance that users may complain about is that users must click into a course page to add it to their schedule. An option to select and add multiple courses from the course search page would save users time from having to click into each individual course page. An additional feature that would help enhance the user experience could be the implementation of major and minor tracking sheets, so that students can easily see what courses they have taken and will need to take. This would help increase confidence in students that they are selecting the correct courses for their major or minor.

                      User Centricity
                    </h3>
                    <p class="title text-left">
                      In general, MyWorkday feels like a template site masked for WPI scheduling. With many unnecessary features, the site feels like it is not designed for students, but rather employees in a company. Since WPI has its own set of course and registration rules, the site should feel tailored to those rules. One example of unnecessary features is that when clicking into the courses, it gives you the option to download the course info as an excel or PDF. This is a neat feature but I do not see it being very practical in any case when you are just trying to schedule. From a user perspective, the more options that you give, the more complicated the interface becomes. With an already stressful process like course scheduling, the dashboard should be as simple as possible.

                      Conclusion
                    </h3>
                    <p class="title text-left">
                      All things considered, MyWorkday at WPI leaves a lot on the table in terms of possibilities for enhancing the user experience.Workday should consider taking user feedback to figure out what users actually need. In this manner they will be able to specifically design the site to the students’ needs. With some functional and design adjustments, the application has the potential to provide a seamless and exceptional user experience.
                    </p>


                    <h2 class="text-left"> Art and Design Critique </h2>
                 <p>The workday site could have a better User experience by making it more relatable to the WPI students , for example,  the concept of similarity. Almost all WPI Sites have a standard red and white design whereas Workday has a Blue design. This leads to the user not understanding at the first glance that the Website is related to WPI due to the Similarity not existing.
                  While they have used different sizes, the sizes have not been used in a way that would help users understand the importance of one part over the second part as the sizes have not been standardized. 
                  They have used a standard shape for all the details which would be great for the user to understand what parts are similar. The buttons being in a different shape brings attention to the fact that they are buttons and hence give the users a better experience. 
                  They have the boxes with details separated but the colors are not present to separate the contents of the box from one another. This would lead to an issue for the user to differentiate the contents from one another as there is no color differentiation between them to make it easier. 
                  While the White space is used effectively for the users to better help understand the different sections of the site, the proximity is slightly jarring from the Design perspective as the things in proximity would be better of related to one another to help users reach the section of the site they want to interact with on the site faster and easier</p>

            <p>This study looked at measuring perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, and behavioral intention. The study was designed in three phases: First was a user study, second was a user scenario while a prototype interface was tested and modified to develop an improved version of the interface, and the third phase consisted of empirical tests comparing the original version with the improved interactive interface.</p>
            <h5>Conclusions</h5>
            <p>The users’ past UX must never be neglected when such a multi-purpose interactive interface is developed for complex reading activities.</p>
            <p>To enhance acceptance of UX for users, designers as well as system developers who are concerned with diversified and interactive technological products should have an in-depth understanding of UX. Also, guided by the contemporary trend of life, they should introduce as much technology as possible to users' daily life, instead of forcing users to adapt to rigid technology.</p>
            <p>The line between in-depth reading and shallow reading cannot be drawn by this study.</p>
            <p>This study also only looked at the Apple iPad when using iBooks but the comparison can be useful for the behavioral experiences of general users for any reading material.</p>

            <p>This study aimed to improve the vehicle navigation interface use experience through user behavior and emotional response. Understanding the behavioral response can allow the user to better accept the navigation information in the vehicle. The research will highlight not only the importance of users behavior and experience in interface design, but also the necessity of taking effective measures to cater to users' emotional needs.</p>
            <h5>Conclusions</h5>
            <p>User behavior research can enable information interaction projects to build upon and transcend designers’ expertise and expectations during vehicle navigation interface design.</p>
            <p>The user behavior method is a system and strategic approach involving spatial cognition and spatial behavior planning.</p>
            <p>The concept in the analysis is designed to improve the perceived efficiency, reduce the difficulty of understanding and enhance the ability to predict the performance of the principle, the detail design based on three kinds of mental models for the specific design principles, the completion of the organization and visualization of information design issues
            </p>
            <p>The designer needs the information task of the application to create an effective system, that focus is to enhance the understanding of information.
            </p>
            <p>Positive feedback should be given to the users’ task status and operation.
            </p>
            <p>The interface design emphasis is on enhancing the user's assessment of behavior and helping the user form a good cognitive and behavioral plan.</p>

            <p>This study set out to understand the effects of mobile-page and homepage designs on small-screen devices. Two experimental studies were conducted to examine how users evaluated interface designs. The researchers developed two guidelines for mobile news websites: the single-page design is favored over the multi-page. In addition, a homepage with a thumbnail design fascilitates information processing better than the progressive and list-view designs.</p>
            <h5>Conclusions</h5>
            <p>The homepage design is crucial because it determines how quickly information can be located. A user-friendly homepage usually contains a vast amount of information with a clear organization for different news sections.</p>
            <p>First, among the three types of interface designs we examined, the single-page and multi-page designs were rated as easier to read than the zooming design.</p>
            <p>In other words, enhanced interactivity can significantly increase users’ intentions to browse a mobile website. Therefore, interactivity should be taken into consideration when designing mobile web interfaces in order to attract new users or retain existing ones.</p>
            <p>The major findings in both of our studies are that “simpler is better.</p>
            <p>They may also prefer less information at first and having the choice to view information step by step.</p>

            <p>This study analyses the users use habits on a website from the perspective of the user's experience. It explores the principles of usage of visual elements in web design based on the user experience.</p>
            <h5>Conclusions</h5>
            <p>Three principles of visual elements in web design</p>
            <p>Contrast Principle consists of size contrast, brightness contrast, comparison of horizontal and vertical lines, and texture.</p>
            <p>Coordination principle consists of main and subordinate, dynamic and static, and out of and into. The dynamic part includes dynamic picture and process of things, static part refers to the button on the interface or text.</p>
            <p>Fun principles consist of use of the image, intuitive, vivid graphics optimized interface. It also is the ratio between the title and the text is the rate of change.</p>

            <h2 class="s-title">The UX Five-Second Rules</h2>
            <p>This study establishes a set of guidelines designed to assist those who wish to use the five-second method to test their designs. The guidelines address the viability of the method for specific types of research inquries, as well as how to properly design, structure, and execute different test formats.</p>
            <h5>Conclusions</h5>
            <p>The five second test is used when trying to assess immediate feelings associated when a user sees the content. It should never be the only method used to assess a design.</p>
            <ul class="fiveseclist">
              <li>Don’t use a five-second test when a different research method will produce better results for you.</li>
              <li>Focus on the specific design aspect(s) you want to test and employ the appropriate test format.</li>
              <li>Don’t give participants any excuse to say “I don’t know” or “I don’t remember”.
              </li>
              <li>Devote time to crafting proper instructions.
              </li>
              <li>Optimize the test image so that scrolling is eliminated.</li>
              <li>There is no “magic number” for how many questions to ask, but fewer is usually better.</li>
              <li>Order the questions optimally.</li>
              <li>Pay careful attention to how the questions are worded.</li>
              <li>Ask the “most prominent element” question with discretion.</li>
              <li>Open-ended feedback requests carry a high risk of nonresponses and low-information answers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The main purposes of a home or landing page are generally universal: (a) to give users high-level information about a site and (b) to provide a means of getting to the more specific content areas within the site.</p>
            <p>Use images that do not force the viewer to scroll, yet provide the visual information necessary for participants to answer test questions meaningfully.</p>
            <p>n such cases, asking the “most prominent” question most likely serves to confirm an explicit design decision, rather than to uncover something that is not already known or suspected.</p>

            <p>This study focus on motion in user interfaces as a design element which can contribute to an improved user experience of digital media entertainment. The researchers studied affective qualities which are the features of an artifact that can influence emotion.</p>
            <h5>Conclusions</h5>
            <p>When designing for better experiences, it has become important to provide a holistic experience with consideration to emotion.</p>
            <p>From the above results and statistical analyses, we were able to verify that the motion element has a significant influence on the seven affective qualities of user interface that were tested.</p>
            <p>The seven affective qualities tested were Refreshing, Calm, Luxurious, Powerful, Youthful, Uniqueness, and Futuristic.</p>
